# Trajectory Calculator
This simulation calculates the trajectory of an object while travelling in atmosphere and includes both atmospheric drag and lateral forces.

## Inputs
- current air temperature
- initial speed of the object
- degree of the shot relative to the ground
- time interval  (recomended value = 0.001 (lower value yields more accurate results but increases the time of calculation))
- hight of the starting point relative to the ground zero

## Output
The output can be changed in the line 102 to show desired parameters.

### Additional
To add lateral forces to the calculation remove the comment status of the line 107.
