# Trajectory-Calculator
For calculating in atmosphere projectile firing simulation.

For calculation variables;
  Current air Temperature: Wanted atmospheric temperature for air resistance calculations.
  Initial Speed: The speed which projectile is fired.
  Degree of Shot: The angle between the ground and trajectory. (In degrees*)
  Time Interval: Changable time interval for equations. Recomended value is minimum 0.01 (Smaller the value, higher the the accuracy will be)
  Height of the Shot: The vertical distance between the ground zero and the projectiles position at t=0
  
 This code can also calculate for lateral forces. For active lateral force just remove the comment status of the function at line 107.
