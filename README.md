# Trajectory Calculator
This simulation calculates the trajectory of an object while travelling in atmosphere and includes both atmospheric drag and lateral forces. Since the code is old, there is not much to help user. Therefore, to be able to see lateral forces and edit atmospheric values code has to be editted.

Every input and variable hardcoded to the simulation does serve a purpose.

## Inputs
- current air temperature in Celcius
- initial speed of the object in m/s
- degree of the shot relative to the ground
- time interval (lower value yields more accurate results but increases the time of calculation)
- hight of the starting point relative to the ground zero

## Output
Program outputs a .png file to the same directory where it has been run.

### Important
This an old project of my therefore no further developments will be made.
